# HyperSpin Extra Rom Detector
This program takes an HyperSpin XML database, scans a specified folder, and moves/reports any extra files in folder that are not in the database.
This is useful when scanning roms with Rocket Launcher.  Rocket Launcher will show what games are missing, while this will show any extra (or incorrectly named) files.
